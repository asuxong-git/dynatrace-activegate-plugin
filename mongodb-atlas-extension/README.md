# Dynatrace ActiveGate Plugin for MongoDB Atlas

This is the home of the Dynatrace ActiveGate Plugin for MongoDB Atlas.  This plugin can be used to monitor a MongoDB instance deployed via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), where the installation of a Dynatrace OneAgent is not possible.

## About Dynatrace ActiveGate Plugins
With [ActiveGate Plugins](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/activegateplugin-sdk/activegate-plugins-intro/), you can integrate Dynatrace monitoring with any remote technology that exposes an interface. You don’t need to install OneAgent. ActiveGate plugins run in ActiveGate and gather data remotely. 
With deep integration, Dynatrace can import not only other technologies’ metrics, properties, and events, but also their topologies, which can be subsequently analyzed with the Dynatrace AI! 
Along with this ability to monitor new technologies comes one of the main benefits of Dynatrace: causation between user actions, technology-specific data, transactional visibility, and more.


## Overview

The Dynatrace ActiveGate Plugin for MongoDB Atlas is a remote based plugin that runs on the Dynatrace ActiveGate.  The plugin 
systematically requests the [MongoDB Atlas API](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/) to retrieve information about the MongoDB Cluster and Nodes and the corresponding metrics.

## 1 Usage
